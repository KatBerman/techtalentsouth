## What is BREW?

For Mac OS, Linux

Home-brew installs the stuff you need that Apple or your Linux system didn’t.  
[See list of all packages](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/)


	⁃	BREW package definition files are called “formulae”
	⁃	BREW “cask”, just like a formula, is for GUI installs.
	⁃	BREW “cellar” is where everything is installed /usr/local/Cellar


The simplest way to create a formula for your own software is to create a GitHub repository called homebrew-<something>; put your formula file in it; then type brew tap <username>/<something> to add this new source of formulae to your Homebrew installation and so get access to all its formulae.


Companies have internal Homebrew taps for their own utilities. There are a lot of public taps like homebrew/science for scientific software, atlassian/tap for Atlassian software, and ska-sa/tap for radio astronomy.

## What is CHOCOLATEY?

For Windows

Chocolatey has the largest online registry of Windows packages. Chocolatey packages encapsulate everything required to manage a particular piece of software into one deployment artifact by wrapping installers, executables, zips, and/or scripts into a compiled package file.

## Package Application Managers
You can install the executables of Anaconda, Conda, Python or you can use a Package Application Manager that is applicable to your operating system. This allows you to maintain, update, install and configure all the necessary software components via automated scripting.
