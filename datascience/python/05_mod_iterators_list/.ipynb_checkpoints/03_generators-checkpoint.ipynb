    "In simple terms, a container is iterable, if we can go through all its elements using a for loop. All the sequences are iterable, but there are other iterable objects as well. We can even create iterable types ourselves. In our class there needs to be a special method __iter__ that returns an iterator for the container. An iterator is an object that has method __next__, which returns the next element from the container. Let’s have a look at a simple example where the container and its iterator is the same class."
