    "We have already seen that we can ask from a string str whether it begins with some substring as follows: str.startswith('Apple'). If we would like to know whether it starts with \"Apple\" or \"apple\", we would have to call startswith method twice. Regular expressions offer a simpler solution: re.match(r\"[Aa]pple\", str). The bracket notation is one example of the special syntax of regular expressions. In this case it says that any of the characters inside brackets will do: either \"A\" or \"a\". The other letters in \"pple\" will act normally. The string r\"[Aa]pple\" is called a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complicated example asks whether the string str starts with either apple or banana (no matter if the first letter is capital or not): re.match(r\"[Aa]pple|[Bb]anana\", str). In this example we saw a new special character | that denotes an alternative. On either side of the bar character we have a subpattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "A legal variable name in Python starts with a letter or an underline character and the following characters can also be digits. So legal names are, for instance: _hidden, L_value, A123_. But the name 2abc is not a valid variable name. Let’s see what would be the regular expression pattern to recognise valid variable names: r\"[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z_0-9]*\\Z\". Here we have used a shorthand for character ranges: A-Z. This means all the characters from A to Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first character of the variable name is defined in the first brackets. The subsequent characters are defined in the second brackets. The special character * means that we allow any number (0,1,2, … ) of the previous subpattern. For example the pattern r\"ba*\" allows strings \"b\", \"ba\", \"baa\", \"baaa\", and so on. The special syntax \\Z denotes the end of the string. Without it we would also accept abc- as a valid name since the match function normally checks only that a string starts with a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The special notations, like \\Z, also cause problems with string handling. Remember that normally in string literals we have some special notation: \\n stands for newline, \\t stands for tab, and so on. So, both string literals and regular expressions use similar looking notations, which can create serious confusion. This can be solved by using the so-called raw strings. We denote a raw string by having an r letter before the first quotation mark, for example r\"ab*\\Z\". When using raw strings, the newline (\\n), tab (\\t), and other special string literal notations aren’t interpreted. One should always use raw strings when defining regular expression patterns!"

Very complex text processing can be achieved using regular expressions.\n",
